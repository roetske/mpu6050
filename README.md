working with mpu6050

Working with gyros and accelerometer.
If you want to make balancing robot or use any kind of balancing eg copter. You need to work with gyro and accelerometer.

Mpu6050 or adxl345 are good starters.
Coding so many examples and once you start you get stuck so easy. So many libraries but info is hard to get and makes you struggle
because of lack of it.
When measuring angles you need a sampletime right in your code.
Use of filter to stabilize your readings.
